    "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)\nis a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to\nrun, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster\non a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your\nservices or tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control, you can host\nyour tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances\nthat you manage by using the EC2 launch type. For more information about launch\ntypes, see Amazon ECS Launch Types\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html].\n\nAmazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-based applications with simple API\ncalls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service,\nand gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.\n\nYou can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your\ncluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability\nrequirements. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster\nmanagement and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your\nmanagement infrastructure.",
